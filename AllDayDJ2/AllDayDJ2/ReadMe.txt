AllDay DJ 2.0 Read Me
=====================


Installation
------------

Just extract this zip file to a folder of your choice and run. Should you run into problems, just drop me a line
via. my website at http://www.radioautomation.co.nr/

Initial Setup
-------------

Load the program. Goto Options -> Login. The username is admin and the password is adminpassword. Go to Options ->
Settings. From here your hardware and sound settings can be configured.

Reload the program (this brings any hardware changes in the settings into effect). Login again. Go to Options ->
Database. Create the playlists that you require. Once done, click on close. Go back into Options -> Database and
select each playlist one by one and click on tracks. Click on the + button and add the tracks to the playlist.

Note that if you choose a folder with a large number of files it may take a while, it is a fully automated process.
AllDay DJ will assume that the last time the volume is at or above 50% is the end point and that the first point
the volume is above 0 is the start point. All tracks will be assumed to have a fade ending (a 2 second fade 
is performed on any track with this setting in the database).

Once all of the tracks for the playlist are entered into the playlist, click on close. Repeat the above for each
playlist. Once done, click on close. The program will now reload the database. This can be forced manually at
any time by clicking on "Reload Database" on the menu bar.

You are now ready to use AllDay DJ.
